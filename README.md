# Data Visualization

A data visualization project using D3.js. I created this project to learn more about D3.js. I'm continuously adding to it.

## Getting Started

Each graph has it's own .js file named with what type of graph it is. The data for each graph is included in its file. The html has divs with ID's matching the type of graph.

Example: barChart.js includes code for the pie chart and the data it uses. In the html, it appears in a div with the ID #pie.


## Built With

* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)
